This script is designed to scrape and analyze data from the Immaculate Grid for football, specifically focusing on counting the occurrences of unique team pairings across different grids.


An **Immaculate Grid** for football is a daily trivia game that challenges players to fill a 3x3 grid with correct matches of football players to teams or specific criteria.

### How It Works:

1. **Grid Structure**: 
   - The grid consists of 9 cells arranged in a 3x3 format.
   - Each column and row is labeled with the name of an NFL team or a specific achievement (e.g., "Pro Bowl," "1,000-yard season").

2. **Objective**: 
   - For each cell, the player must identify a football player who satisfies both the criteria of the row and the column.
   - For example, if a row is labeled "Cowboys" and a column is labeled "Patriots," the player must name someone who has played for both the Dallas Cowboys and the New England Patriots.

3. **Rarity Score**:
   - The game tracks how common or rare a particular answer is. Selecting a less obvious player results in a higher rarity score, adding an extra layer of challenge for those who want to aim for a top score.
